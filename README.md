# Project Euler Solutions

These are my solutions to some of the problems of [Project Euler](https://www.projecteuler.net).

Most problems have been solved in python, but some of the longer running ones have been solved in C.

The Python solutions can be run via the command `python solve all` or `python solve <n>`, where `n` is the problem number.
